## start up

The blogreg package contains many sub-directories that must be present on the Matlab path for the files to work. You can add these sub-directories to the Matlab path by typing (in Matlab) 'addpath(genpath(blogerg_dir))', where 'blogreg_dir' is the directory that the zip file is extracted to.
